    <p>AdaBoost is short for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AdaBoost">Adaptive Boosting</a>. AdaBoost is used in
    conjunction with other learning algorithms to improve their performance (it boosts other algorithms). Boosting is a 
    general method for improving the accuracy of any given learning algorithm. So obviously, adaptive boosting refers to
    a boosting algorithm that can adjust itself to changing scenarios.</p>

    <p>Let’s say you are given the task of listing out all the people in the city of San Francisco who are taller than 
    5’7″,and weigh less than 190 lbs. Now the problem is that you are supposed to do this without the help of machines. 
    All you are allowed to do is take a look at the person and determine whether or not that person qualifies. How do we
    do it?</p>
    
    <p>You may or may not be good at estimating these parameters just by looking at the person. So to improve the accuracy,
    you get two people (<em>weak learners</em>) to help you out. The first person is really good at guessing the height,
    the second person is really good at guessing the weight. Individually, they may not be useful to you, because they can
    do only one simple task. But if you combine them together then results of their work would be much more accurate.</p>
    
    <h4 id="Learning-process">Learning process<a class="anchor-link" href="#Learning-process"></a></h4>
    
    <p>So you have two helpers and each one of them is good at something. Now it is time to train them before they started
    to do a real work. You show them people whose parameters you know and they look at them one after another. Every learner
    tries to classify a person that he/she sees. After an attempt of classification you mark correctly and incorrectly
    classified examples and stress out that incorrect ones are more important. Also by ratio of correct/incorrect examples
    you estimate learner's performance. This estimates will be useful at the time of making predictions. The subsequent
    learner sees same set of examples and your marks and tries to reclassify incorrect examples in the first place. Then
    you mark results of that learner and the learner his-/herself. This process repeats until all known examples are
    classified correctly or number of incorrect ones is minimal.</p>
    
    <p>Learning process can be explained in slightly more rigorous terms using a diagram below:</p>
    <p><img src="people.jpg" align="center"></p>
    
    <ol>
      <li>Weak learner suggests a hypothesis <em>h<sub>1</sub></em> (all people lighter than 190 lbs qualify)</li>
      <li>Applying <em>h<sub>1</sub></em> divides all data into two parts: qualified (blue) and not qualified (pink). Besides
      correct examples the blue part also contains incorrect ones that should belong to pink part. It means that
      <em>h<sub>1</sub></em> is not good enough, that is why a learner who suggested it is called weak.</li>
      <li>Although the learner is weak a pretty good job is done and a lot of examples are classified correctly. So weight
      of learner's opinion should be increased (and set to <em>w<sub>1</sub></em>).</li>
      <li>Incorrect examples in blue part marked as important - their weight is increased and they will be rechecked later.</li>
      <li>Another weak learner suggests a hypothesis <em>h<sub>2</sub></em> (all people higher than 5’7″ qualify)</li>
      <li>Applying <em>h<sub>2</sub></em> also divides all data into two parts: qualified (blue) and not qualified (pink). At
      this time the blue part also contains incorrect examples that should belong to pink part.</li>
      <li>Weight of this learner's opinion also re-estimated because it also makes some sense (weight is also increased and
      set to <em>w<sub>2</sub></em>).</li>
      <li>Incorrect classifications are reweighed and now you are ready to produce a final hypothesis <em>H</em> that is
      aware of all previous hypotheses and weights of learners. You need just to sum up the results using weighted average:</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h4 id="Predicting-process">Predicting process<a class="anchor-link" href="#Predicting-process">¶</a></h4>
    <p>When all learners are trained then they are ready to make predictions. You show them person whose parameters you 
    do not know and they make their guesses. Afterwards you do a conclusion looking at learners' predictions and weights 
    you have obtained during learning. In other words you are just using your final hypothesis <em>H</em>.</p>

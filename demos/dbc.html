            Before making a distinction between different dog breeds, the application
            tries to decide if human or dog is depicted on the image. OpenCV's implementation
            of <a href="https://docs.opencv.org/trunk/d7/d8b/tutorial_py_face_detection.html">Haar
            feature-based cascade classifiers</a> is used to detect human faces in images.
          </p>
          <p>
            A pre-trained ResNet-50 model is used, to detect dogs. The application downloads the
            <a href="http://ethereon.github.io/netscope/#/gist/db945b393d40bfa26006">ResNet-50 model</a>,
            along with weights that have been trained on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ImageNet">
            ImageNet</a>, a large and popular dataset used for image classification and other computer vision
            tasks. ImageNet contains over 10 million URLs, each linking to an image containing an object from one
            of <a href="https://gist.github.com/yrevar/942d3a0ac09ec9e5eb3a">1000 categories</a>. Given an image,
            this pre-trained ResNet-50 model returns a prediction (derived from the available categories in
            ImageNet) for the object that is contained in the image.
          </p>
          <p>
            Distinguishing between dog breeds is a complex task but Convolutional Neural Networks perform well
            on it. While it is possible to learn the network from scratch, it is reasonable to use transfer
            learning. The key advantage of transfer learning is the usage of bottleneck features of a pre-trained model.
            A new model consists mostly of fully-connected layers and takes bottleneck features as input.
            Only those layers are trained afterward. Models built like that, show 
            <a href="https://blog.keras.io/building-powerful-image-classification-models-using-very-little-data.html">
            excellent performance</a> and spare a lot of time and computational power to be trained.
          </p>
          <p>
            The pre-trained model named <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02357">Xception</a> is used to solve the
            problem. Global average pooling layer and Fully-connected layer provide a new model trained on
            available images. To make a classification, Xception takes an image as input and returns bottleneck
            features. The features go into the new model as input and new model makes the classification.

            Current approach (OpenCV and Haar Cascades), despite being quite accurate, seems to be
            not very appropriate for detecting faces from noisy input provided by real users the
            application like this. An image's rotation of more than 19 degrees makes it impossible for
            Haar cascade to recognize face.
          </p>
          <p>
            OpenCV algorithms can be tuned by using more features, e.g. not only frontal face images
            but right and left profiles. However it still makes sense to try out other approaches
            such as CNNs. Convolutional neural nets are able to recognize patterns on images regardless
            of their positions.
